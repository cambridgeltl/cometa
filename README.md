# COMETA: the corpus of online medical entities

This repo holds code for running baseline models presented in our [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.253/): *COMETA: A Corpus for Medical Entity Linking in the Social Media* at EMNLP 2020.

COMETA is an entity linking dataset of layman medical terminology. It has been collected by analysing four years of content in 68 health-themed subreddits and annotating the most frequent with their corresponding SNOMED-CT entities. Each term is assigned two annotations: a General SNOMED-CT identifier and a Specific one, denoting respectively the literal and contextual meaning of the term. 

For a copy of the corpus, please follow instructions on our [website](https://siphs.org/corpus).
